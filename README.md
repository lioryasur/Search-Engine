# Search Engine

This Github repository contains the code for a search engine developed as part of a university project. The goal of the project was to create a functional search engine that is able to return relevant results for a Wikipedia-based corpus.

## Features
- The search engine uses techniques for indexing and retrieval of information, including the use of Cosine Similarity and BM25. 
- The search engine was optimized for precision, and was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Average Precision at 40 (MAP@40), recall, and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to measure its performance.
- The search engine also has a feature for correcting spelling errors in queries in order to improve the results, and we're also using stemming on the title index to improve it's results.

## Index
The index used in the final version of the search engine is available in the Google Storage Bucket "gs://316336338-index"
